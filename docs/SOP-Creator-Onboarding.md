# SOP: Creator Onboarding

## Overview
This document outlines the standard operating procedure for onboarding new UGC creators after they join the Bet.AI Creator Program.

---

## 1. Creator's Onboarding Checklist

When a creator joins, they see this checklist in their dashboard:

| Step | Task | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Sign contract | Sent separately via email |
| 2 | Read Content Guide | Available in dashboard |
| 3 | **Connect Discord** | Must use platform button (creates private channel) |
| 4 | Create TikTok/IG accounts | For Bet.AI content |
| 5 | Warm up accounts | 2-3 days of normal activity |
| 6 | Watch Editing Tutorial | Available in dashboard |
| 7 | Post first video | Following content guide |
| 8 | Submit video link | Through dashboard |

---

## 2. Discord Connection (Critical)

### How it works
Creators **must** connect Discord through the platform's "Connect Discord" button in their checklist. This:
- Adds them to the Discord server
- Creates a **private support channel** for them
- Assigns appropriate roles (Verified, UGC Creator)
- Sends welcome message with checklist
- Notifies admins in #new-creators channel
- DMs admins for immediate follow-up

### Important
Do NOT share direct Discord invite links. Direct links bypass the OAuth flow and won't create private channels.

## 3. When a Creator Connects Discord

### You'll receive:
1. **DM notification** with creator name and private channel link
2. **#new-creators channel** notification

### What to do:
1. Go to creator's private channel immediately
2. Welcome them personally
3. Send their **promo code**
4. Share TestFlight link: `https://testflight.apple.com/join/D824t57J`
5. Ask if they have any questions
6. Remind them to:
   - Download the app & leave a 5-star rating
   - Start warming up their accounts

---

## 4. Welcome Message Template

Use this as a starting point in their private channel:

```
Hey [Name]! Welcome to the team 🎉

Here's your promo code: [CODE]

Quick reminders:
• Download the app: https://testflight.apple.com/join/D824t57J
• Leave us a 5-star rating on the App Store 🙏
• Start warming up your TikTok/IG accounts (2-3 days)
• Check out #content-rules for video guidelines

Any questions? Just message here!
```

## 5. Sending Welcome Notification (Optional)

If a creator hasn't connected Discord yet:
1. Find them in Admin → Creators
2. Click the **envelope icon** (Send Welcome)
3. This sends an in-app notification prompting them to open their checklist

---

## 6. Monitoring Progress

### In the Admin Dashboard:
- **Discord status**: Shows if connected (with username) or pending
- **Checklist progress**: View via checklist icon on creators
- **Welcome notification status**: Shows Sent/Viewed/Not Sent

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Creator can't connect Discord
- Ensure they're clicking the button in their dashboard checklist (not a direct link)
- Check if they already have a Discord account
- Have them try in an incognito browser

### Creator not receiving emails
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Verify email address is correct
- Ask them to check spam folder

### Creator has questions about content
- Point them to #content-rules channel
- Share example videos from the welcome message in their private channel
